load from same model folder if you started from a checkpoint.

colorbar for viz?
lr decay on plateau
easy hyperparam opt.

itamar:
metrics
training process, false analysis with nb.

tomorrow:
nb for analysis
add gradient metric.


go over runs, delete what isn't interesting, connect between run and model trained.
make the configs file less shit.
foldername AND run_name? what's wrong with you..
should eval_net be in train?

nitzan 31.12.20
next steps:
    configs make more sense.
    try to reduce overfit - optuna?
    clean up
    try to make a test? on hills
    inference mode
Overfitting
    clean images (take out shit)
    dropout
    lr plateau
    augs move a bit
future work:
    test time augs as majority vote
    save best
    stress test to check how robust model is (future work).
    fix rotated images.
